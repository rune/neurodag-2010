Nicotine increases serotonergic and  noradrenergic neuronal activity and facilitates serotonin and noradrenaline release. In  mice, acute nicotine administration enhances the activity of antidepressants in the  mouse forced swim (mFST) and tail suspension tests (mTST). Here, we investigated if  this action of nicotine is also reflected in a chronic treatment regimen. Given that  chronic nicotine produces a chronic facilitation of 5-HT and NE transmission, it is  possible that adaptive changes similar to those observed after chronic administration  with antidepressants may occur. In rodents, chronic administration with selective  serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and selective noradrenaline (NE) reuptake  inhibitor (NRI) antidepressants is associated with blunted hypothermic responses to  agonists at the inhibitory 5-HT1A receptor and &amp;Icirc;&amp;plusmn;2-adrenoceptors,  respectively. Furthermore, chronic antidepressant treatment is accompanied by decreased  expression levels of the transporters for 5-HT (SERT) and NE (NET). After chronic  treatment with nicotine in the drinking water, mice were challenged with nicotine,  duloxetine, citalopram and reboxetine in the mFST. In addition, 8-OH-DPAT- and  clonidine-induced hypothermia was tested in vehicle- and nicotine-pretreated mice, as a  measure of 5-HT1a and &amp;Icirc;&amp;plusmn;2-adrenoceptor function, respectively. Finally,  the effects on the brain expression levels of high- and low-affinity nicotinic  acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and the transporters for serotonin (SERT) and  noradrenaline (NET), were assessed using (3H)epibatidine,  (3H)&amp;Icirc;&amp;plusmn;-bungarotoxin, (3H)citalopram and (3H)nisoxetine binding,  respectively. Behavioural and hypothermia data were analysed by two-way analysis of  variance (ANOVA) and three-way repeated measures ANOVA, respectively. Radioligand  binding data were analysed with Student&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s t-test. In the mFST,  nicotine-pretreated mice did not show altered response to the nicotine challenge, but  increased responses to all three antidepressants tested was observed when compared to  mice that had been administered drinking water without nicotine. There was no change in  hypothermic responses to 8-OH-DPAT or clonidine. (3H)epibatidine binding was  significantly increased in all brain regions investigated, whereas  (3H)&amp;Icirc;&amp;plusmn;-bungarotoxin, (3H)citalopram and (3H)nisoxetine binding was not  altered, indicating that chronic oral nicotine increases the expression and/or affinity  of high-affinity nAChRs, but not low-affinity nAChRs, SERT or NET. It is suggested that  the increased sensitivity to antidepressants after chronic nicotine exposure involves  increased high-affinity nAChRs-mediated neurotransmission.<br>	<br>"
