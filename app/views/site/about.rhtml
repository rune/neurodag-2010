	Neurodag conference was commenced for the first time in 2003 and can summarized by the following bullets:
	<p>	
		<ul>
			<li>
			  <p>&quot;Neurodag&quot;
							is an informal one-day conference with the aim of assembling
							national and international neuroscientists from basic sciences,
							clinical research and the medical industry for an intensive
							discussion and exchange of knowledge and experience.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>&quot;Neurodag&quot;
							provides a possibility for researchers from all fields of
							neuroscience to get together and obtain information about
							methods and research ideas in other related research
							environments.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>&quot;Neurodag&quot;
							also provides an opportunity for research laboratories to
							present their work with the aim of attracting young research
							talents. In return young scientists will have the opportunity
							to get an idea of the opportunities available in the field of
							neuroscience.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			  <p>It is the hope that
							the &quot;Neurodag&quot; will contribute to an effective
							translation of knowledge between the various research areas in
							the field and in particular from basic science to clinical
							research and the medical industry.<br>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
					<p>We invite you to participate in an oral presentation 
							competition for young scientists. For more information go to <%= link_to  "How to participate in presentation competition", competitioninfo_path %>
